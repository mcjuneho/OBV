Yices2 is covered under the GPLv3 license. Linking smt-switch against the Yices2 library
alters the license of smt-switch.

If you choose to link against Yices2, you must obtain the Yices2 library yourself and
ensure you meet all the license requirements.

To link against the Yices2 library, download Yices2 from
https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2 and place the directory in ./deps.

Then, build the yices2 library:
cd deps/yices2
autoconf
./configure
make build_dir=build BUILD=build

Now you should be able to build smt-switch with Yices2 as a backend solver by configuring
smt-switch with the --yices2 flag.
