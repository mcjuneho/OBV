MathSAT5 is covered under a custom license. Linking smt-switch against the MathSAT5
library alters the license of smt-switch.

If you choose to link against MathSAT5, you must obtain the MathSAT5 library yourself
and ensure you meet all the license requirements.

To link against the MathSAT5 library, download mathsat from
https://mathsat.fbk.eu/download.html. Place the compressed files in ./deps and unpack
it. Then rename the toplevel directory to mathsat. smt-switch will look for the files
in ./deps/mathsat.

Now you should be able to build smt-switch with MathSAT5 as a backend solver by
configuring smt-switch with the --msat flag.
