# Tests Using the Boolector Solver

These tests demonstrate the usage of the API and test your installation of Boolector. These are meant to be run after an installation of `smt-switch`.

To install `smt-switch` with `boolector`, you would run the following from the top-level directory:
`sudo make install install-btor`

# Dependencies

We have tried to automate dependency installations for unusual packages, but we have not installed all the boolector dependencies that you can rely on a package manager for. If your build is not working, please see the installation instructions on the boolector [github](https://github.com/Boolector/boolector).
